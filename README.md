# h-isthebestletter (Yes that's me)

Hi, I am one of the two vice-presidents of **RdeV** (from 2024 to 2025), a computing club at River Valley High School. Most of my work revolves around RdeV.
RdeV is not the average computing club. It focuses on making software (primarily websites) that benefit the school and its users.

Here are my contributions to RdeV:
- Major refactoring of [rvhsgamejam.x10.mx](https://rvhsgamejam.x10.mx), including making the website more responsive.
- Designer, backend and frontend engineer of RVQuest (not yet released).
- Sole contributor and designer of a [PeerView](https://peerview.x10.mx) rewrite. Work in progress, the unfinished product can be found [here](https://new.peerview.x10.mx).
- Designer of current PeerView.
- Custom-made bingo application used by seniors as part of contributions back to the community.
- Taught a Godot 4 course.

Outside of RdeV, I also have many accomplishments.
- CSIT Computing scholarship reciepient (2024).
- 3 time participant (2021, 2022, 2024) in the RVHS Gamejam, an annual game jam for River Valley High School.
- Plenty of experience (>5 years) with Python and Lua, with some experience (~1 year) in Rust, JavaScript.
- Currently learning TypeScript.
- Have used countless tools, notable ones being
  - Flask (Python)
  - Roblox (Luau)
  - Svelte
  - Express.js (TypeScript)
  - Tauri v2 (Rust)
  - SQLite and MySQL
