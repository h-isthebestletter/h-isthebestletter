# h-isthebestletter (Yes that's me)

Hey there! Are you looking for someone who:
- Has ~5 years of Python experience but is still complete trash at it (what's vectorization)?
- Fools around with Rust and writes the worst code possible?
- Laughs at JS but uses it badly anyway?
- Wrote around 4000 lines of terrible Lua code?

### Well...
- It is I, h-isthebestletter. No "g"s. (kidding). I am the man you have been looking for.
- If you ever come across this, this is a private account with only private repos for now.
